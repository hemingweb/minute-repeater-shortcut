#Minute Repeater shortcut

This is my first attempt at creating an Apple Shortcut, so it is a bit rought

The basic idea is that it will chime out the time. it plays an hour chime for the number of hours, then the minute and hour chimes for the 10 minutes in the current time followed by the remaining minute chimes. There is a pause of "1" between each chiming set.

I had hoped to activate the shortcut from the Apple Watch Ultra action button, but its a little clumsey at the minute, due to the way the action button launching the shortcut app then having to select the Minute Repeater shotcut
